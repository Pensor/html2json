<h1>ARDBEG WHISKY</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Ardbeg is one of the most popular distilleries from the Isle of Islay. Ardbeg is famous for its smoky malts with typical citrus notes. The annual special bottlings regularly cause a sensation.</p>
<h3>STYLE</h3>
<p>What does Ardbeg single malt taste like? Ardbeg is one of the most famous Scottish distilleries, and its whiskies are among the most extreme Scotch whiskies of all: they are characterised by an extraordinarily high peat or phenol content, which in the case of most Ardbeg whiskies is over 50 ppm in the malt. The Ardbeg Supernova even exceeded 100 ppm. Most bottlings shine with a very smoky appearance of almost medicinal character, which is usually refined by a citrus note typical of Ardbeg. "Extreme", "idiosyncratic", "powerful", "intense" and "extraordinary" are the adjectives most often used when describing an Ardbeg whisky. In addition, the whisky is generally not chill-filtered or colour-adjusted with sugar couleur.</p>
<h3>PRODUCTION</h3>
<p>How is Ardbeg whisky made? This easternmost of the three distilleries on the south coast of Islay has a 5-tonne stainless steel mash tun and six wooden Douglas spruce washbacks (each with a capacity of 23,500 litres). The water for this comes from the two lochs Arinambeast and Uigeadail. The malted barley is produced at the Port Ellen malthouse. The barley malt is strongly smoky and usually has around 50 ppm phenolic content. The fermentation time is comparatively long, 56-57 hours. Ardbeg currently produces about 1.4 million litres of pure alcohol annually in a wash still (18,279 litres) and a spirit still (16,957 litres). Ardbeg's stills have relatively wide necks, which give the distillate a nice oily character. The Spirit Still also has a purifier, which is responsible for the special fruity style of Ardbeg New Make. The whisky is stored in warehouses on site. The proximity to the rough, stormy Scottish Sea also gives the whisky its flavours of salt, sea air and seaweed.</p>
<p>Ardbeg has expanded its production capacity only marginally since the late 19th century, most recently with the introduction of continuous production in 2013. With demand for Ardbeg single malt remaining high, it was announced in 2018 that a new distillery building would be added to the distillery. The existing still house is to accommodate additional washbacks in the future. The new still house will then house 2 additional stills, making a total of 4. This will double the production capacity. This will probably lift Ardbeg - after 2019 - to a production level somewhere between Lagavulin and Bunnahabhain.</p>
<h3>HISTORY</h3>
<p>If there is one legendary whisky distillery in Scotland, it is Ardbeg. The distillery was officially founded in 1815 on the south coast of the famous whisky island of Islay. In fact, however, it was only the subsequent legalisation of a moonshine distillery that had existed at least since 1794 and had previously been operated by smugglers. John MacDougall finally ventured into legality at about the same time as the Johnstons, who founded Laphroaig in 1815 and Lagavulin the following year.</p>
<p>For a long time, Ardbeg was spared the fate of many other Scottish distilleries, which constantly changed hands: until 1959, Ardbeg remained in the possession of the founding MacDougall family, after which things became all the more turbulent! In 1977, the distillery was taken over by the American Hiram Walker group, which was known for its Canadian Club. Walker, however, was not very successful with this Scottish commitment, which is why Ardbeg was shut down in 1981. This period of "mothballing" lasted until 1989, when Allied Distillers, a subsidiary of Allied Domecq PLC based in Bristol, took over the distillery.</p>
<p>But the new owners were not really lucky either, so in July 1996 Ardbeg was mothballed again. A year later, in 1997, Glenmorangie PLC finally came on the scene and acquired the distillery, which by then had become quite neglected, and which underwent a thorough renovation. With Glenmorangie, a new owner had finally been found who had enough capital to handle any necessary investment: Behind Glenmorangie is MoÃ«t Hennessy, the wine and spirits arm of the world's largest luxury conglomerate: LVMH.</p>
